A basic To Do list using PHP, embedded HTML and SQL, JavaScript and CSS.
Basically you either login if you are already registered or sign up with an username and a password.
You can check the Remember me button, which means cookies will be set so it 'autocompletes' the credentials even when you log out.
In case you uncheck it, the cookies will be destroyed.
After you login, you can add a new task, and then check it if completed (or uncheck it), delete it and log out.
This was made only to practice for an upcoming test of PHP. Hopefully it's good enough :)
